        <h3 align="left">Project Summary</h3>

        <p>
            This project is a 2D Grid Based Fluid Dynamics Simulation. Features include a pressure map, velocity map,
            and
            interactions through adding velocity and colors. Some optional tasks will be to implement a viscosity
            slider, a
            density map, and simulate gravity.
        </p>

        <br />

        <h3 align="left">Problem Description</h3>

        <p>
            Fluids are all around us, as the water we drink and as the oil in our cars. People have long studied the
            dynamics of fluids around us, and one way to study them is through visualization. For this project, we have
            decided to create a 2D fluid simulation. Simulations, or visualizations in general, allow people to
            understand
            the object being visualized better while being interesting and aesthetically pleasing.
        </p>

        <p>
            In this project, we want to simulate the motion of 2D fluid over time, with changing velocity and pressure.
            We
            plan to illustrate changes in velocity, pressure, and color, then add some more features as time permits.
            The
            challenges in this project will be how to approximate solutions to differential equations in discrete time
            and
            visualize them in real time.
        </p>

        <br />

        <h3 align="left">Goals and Deliverables (What we <i>Plan</i> to Deliver)</h3>

        <p>
            We plan to have an application that simulates real time Fluid Dynamics in 2D. As a baseline, we plan to have
            a
            UI that can toggle between a pressure and velocity map of a simulated fluid. The fluid will have some
            initial
            velocity for every pixel that the user can set. We also want the user to be able to drop multiple colors of
            dye
            on a pixel or group of pixels into the simulation to watch them dissipate as they are affected by the
            velocities. We plan to check the quality of our simulation visually through the maps, as well as making sure
            it
            is updating at 30 fps (real time).
        </p>

        <p>
            To implement the fluid dynamics simulation, we will be utilizing a 2D velocity field grid which, for each
            pixel,
            the velocity vector of the fluid will be updated for each predetermined, small time step. In order to
            calculate
            the new velocity vectors for each pixel in the field map, we will be employing the Helmholtz-Hodge
            Decomposition
            of the Navier-Stokes equations which take into consideration fluid properties such as: the pressure map from
            the
            previous time step, the velocity map from the previous time step, and the viscosity of the fluid.
        </p>

        <p>
            Some question we plan to answer in the analysis are:
        <ul>
            <li>How do initial conditions affect how the simulation evolves with time?</li>
            <li>How does pressure affect the movement of the fluids?</li>
            <li>How does pressure affect velocity, and how does velocity affect pressure?</li>
            <li>How do the different colors mix together with different initial conditions?</li>
            <li>How does varying the properties of the fluids (viscosity, density, etc) affect the simulation?</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <br />

        <h3 align="left">Goals and Deliverables (What we <i>Hope</i> to Deliver)</h3>

        <p>
            If we are able to complete the baseline tasks ahead of time, we plan to add other parameters to the
            simulation, like gravity, viscosity, and compressibility. If we are feeling the challenge, we can also add a
            temperature map to show how viscosity and gravity would affect temperature.
        </p>

        <p>
            Other stretch goals:
        <ul>
            <li>Allow the browser window to be moved, such that the movement will affect the fluids inside.</li>
            <li>Add compressible fluids and show a density and temperature map of the simulated fluids.</li>
            <li>Simulate multiple fluids simultaneously and observe their interactions with one another.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h3 align="left">Resources</h3>

        <p>
            The computing platform and hardware resources we plan to use are our personal computers. Since we plan to
            render this in real-time, we want to test and develop our scenes on the same devices that will be used to
            view the final results.
        </p>

        <p>
            For software resources, we are planning to use <a href="https://threejs.org" style="color:aqua">ThreeJS</a>
            as a starting point for our
            project. ThreeJS will give us the ability to render scenes. However, we will also ask the course staff for
            other possible scene renderers and starting points. One important criteria is that we want to use something
            lightweight, as we will be rendering scenes in real-time.
