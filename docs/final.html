        <p>
            Our project consisted of generating a 2D-Fluid simulation which was rendered in real-time inside of
            a
            browser window. To accomplish this project, we utilized WebGL, which is supported by most modern
            browsers,
            and implemented the Navier-Stokes equations for non-compressible fluids as shader programs so that
            the
            calculations for the fluid simulation were performed entirely on the GPU. Our implementation
            initializes the
            rendering canvas of the browser window with a 2D velocity map and 2D dye map which are stored in
            textures on
            the GPU and modified accordingly to render the fluid behavior at each time step onto the visible
            canvas. The
            velocity map is used to advect the dye map, producing the colored fluid results in the browser
            window, and
            separate fragment shader programs are used to update the velocity map for each time step, simulating
            the
            behavior of non-compressible fluids. You can view a live demo of the simulation rendering in your browser by
            clicking <a href="2D Fluid Simulator Demo.html" style="color:aqua">here</a>. If the simulation is running
            slowly (as is the case with older graphics hardware), try decreasing the size of your browser window.

        <h3 align="left">The Navier-Stokes Equations:</h3>

        <p>
            To perform a 2D simulation of non-compressible fluids within the browser, we implemented the
            Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible flow defined by the following equations:
        </p>

            <img src="images/navier-stokes/eq1.png" />

        <div align="center">
            <img src="images/navier-stokes/eq2.png" />
        </div>

        <p>
            The equations used were sourced from <a
                href="http://developer.download.nvidia.com/books/HTML/gpugems/gpugems_ch38.html"
                style="color:aqua">NVIDIA GPU Gems Chapter 38 - Fast Fluid Dynamics Simulation</a> on
            the GPU. In the equations, u is the velocity vector consisting of an x velocity and a y velocity,
            represents the density of a fluid, is the viscosity of the fluid, and Fis a vector accounting for
            external forces on the fluid. The first equation listed (we will refer to it as the velocity update
            equation) shows how the various accelerations, such as advection, pressure, diffusion, and external
            forces, are used to determine each of the velocity values in a velocity map for the next time step.
            The second equation is an expression which defines a restriction for the non-compressible fluid
            simulation which is simply that the divergence of the velocity map should be 0 since it would not
            make sense observing a simulation where a fluid is being transported in completely opposite
            directions while also being adjacent to the other stream of fluid being transported.
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <h3 align="left">Implementation:</h3>
        <p>
            In our implementation, we divided the Navier-Stokes velocity update equation into five smaller
            components which consisted of advecting the velocity map, computing the divergence for each
            velocity, updating the pressure map values using Jacobi iteration, subtracting the pressure
            gradients from the velocity map to compute the new velocity values for the next time step, and
            finally advecting the dye with the new velocity map to visualize the fluid simulation. These steps
            were decomposed into <u>five different shader programs</u> each of which had their own fragment
            shader but
            all shared the same vertex shader. The vertex shader drew two triangles to cover the entire screen
            and had varying uv coordinates computed such that the fragment shaders would utilize interpolated uv
            coordinates across the texture coordinate space. The different fragment shaders implemented the
            necessary computations to perform advection, calculate divergence, update the pressure values,
            compute the next time step’s velocity map, and appropriately display the advected colors of the dye
            used to visualize the simulation onto the browser’s canvas. Below is a visualization of the
            computation process for each frame in the simulation.
        </p>


        <div align="center">
            <img src="images/navier-stokes/diagram1.PNG" width="85%" />
        </div>

        <p>
            The actual data being used for each stage of the computations is stored in 2D textures from which
            the fragment shaders can read and write values. For our implementation, we used 2 textures for the
            velocity map, 1 texture for the divergence map, 2 textures for the pressure map, and 2 textures for
            the dye map. With the exception of the divergence map, we utilize two textures for velocity, dye,
            and pressure since calculations involving these values require data to be read from the previous
            state and new data to be written for the next time step state. Thus, we ping pong between the
            textures when rendering each frame of the simulation, reading from one texture and writing the new
            values to the other texture. Only 1 texture was used for divergence, since it is recalculated anew
            at every time step without needing to know its previous values. Much like the two velocity and dye
            textures were used to read the previous state’s values while writing the next state’s computed
            values, the two pressure textures were utilized to perform Jacobi iteration to approximate the
            Poisson distribution and estimate the pressure values for the next time step.
        </p>

        <p>
            There were a couple of simplifying modifications we made to the Navier-Stokes velocity update
            equation in order to maintain a high resolution simulation that was still rendered in real-time.
            First, we did not allow Jacobi iteration to continue until the pressure values converged since doing
            so can sometimes result in a large number of iterations being performed to compute the new pressure
            values, slowing the simulation down. Instead, we set the number of iterations performed to be finite
            with descent results across a broad range of computing hardware. A second simplifying assumption we
            made was that the kinematic viscosity of the fluid was zero, which completely removes the diffusion
            term from the Navier-Stokes equation. The removal of this term only has a minor effect on the
            simulation in that the viscosity of the fluid cannot be changed; thus limiting the simulation to
            modeling only one type of viscosity. We decided to assume a constant viscosity to remove the
            diffusion term from the velocity update equation in favor of utilizing higher resolution textures
            for the velocity, pressure, and divergence maps which have a much more significant effect on the
            quality and visuals of the simulation. Additionally, computing the Laplacian for every term in the
            pressure map is computationally expensive and our preliminary implementations of the diffusion term
            significantly reduced the simulation’s performance on modest computing hardware.
        </p>

        <p>
            We describe in further detail each of the velocity update steps implemented in the following
            sections in the order performed by our implementation.
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <h3 align="left">STEP 1: Velocity Advection</h3>
        <p>
            The first component of the velocity update equation defines the advection of velocity with itself.
            As explained in the GPU Gems article, the velocity map is not only used to advect the fluid, in this
            case our dye map which is used to visualize the flow of fluid, but can also be used to advect
            itself. Intuitively, the velocity of a fluid from a previous area of the 2D grid will have some
            effect on the velocity of the adjacent areas in the 2D grid. Our implementation efficiently performs
            velocity advection by sampling the velocity map at the previous texture coordinates associated with
            the current coordinates velocity and the set timestep value. The previous texture coordinates are
            found by subtracting the current texture coordinates, operated on by the fragment shader, by the
            velocity associated with the current texture coordinates, scaled by delta_t which is our defined
            time step.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h3 align="left">STEP 2: Divergence</h3>
        <p>
            Next, we computed the divergence values for every texture coordinate given the velocity map from the
            previous time step. Since our browser canvas is not guaranteed to have the same width and height
            dimensions, we have to compute the divergence term associated with the x velocity values separately
            from the divergence term associated with the y velocity values. We compute the divergence for x
            velocities and y velocities as follows:
        </p>

            Where:

            <li><img src="images/divergence/eq6.png" align="center" />&nbsp;&nbsp;is the velocity sampled at
                texture
                position (x,y) which
                is now our advected velocity</li>
            <li><img src="images/divergence/eq7.png" align="center" />&nbsp;&nbsp;is the time step of our
                simulation</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Our final divergence calculation is then computed by summing the two divergence values for the x
            velocities and y velocities:
        </p>

        <br>

            Where &nbsp;<img src="images/divergence/eq9.png" align="center" />&nbsp; represents the divergence
            associated
            with texture position (x,y)
        </p>


        <br>
        <h3 align="left">STEP 3: Pressure</h3>
        <p>
            Using the previously computed divergence values, we can estimate pressure for each texture
            coordinate. As stated above, we use Jacobi iteration to approximate the pressure values which are
            defined by a Poisson distribution. For each iteration of the Jacobi approximation, we perform the
            following calculation:
        </p>

        <br>

        <div align="center">
            <img src="images/pressure/eq1.png" />
        </div>

        <br>

        <p>
            Where:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><img src="images/pressure/eq2.png" align="center" />&nbsp;&nbsp;is the computed pressure value
                at texture
                coordinate (x,y) at iteration (i) of Jacobi iteration</li>
            <li><img src="images/pressure/eq3.png" align="center" /></li>
            <li><img src="images/pressure/eq4.png" align="center" /></li>
            <li><img src="images/pressure/eq5.png" align="center" />&nbsp;&nbsp;represents the divergence
                associated with
                texture position (x,y)</li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        <h3 align="left">STEP 4: Velocity-Pressure Gradient</h3>
        <p>
            After estimating the pressure at each texture coordinate at the current time step, we now subtract
            the appropriate pressure gradients from each velocity in our velocity map. This is done by computing
            a scaled difference between the pressure from the 4 texels around our texture coordinate of
            interest, which is subtracted from the advected velocity associated with each texel.
        </p>

        <br>

        <div align="center">

            <li><img src="images/gradients/eq3.png" align="center" />&nbsp;&nbsp;is the x velocity at texture
                coordinates (x,y)</li>

                coordinates (x,y)</li>

                at texture coordinate (x,y)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The final velocity was stored as float values in the 4D color buffer of the texture as follows:
        </p>

            <img src="images/gradients/eq10.png" />
        </div>

        <br>

        <h3 align="left">STEP 5: Dye Advection</h3>
        <p>
            To find the color of each pixel at the current time step, we sampled the color at the computed
            previous position, which is found by subtracting the current coordinate position by that position’s
            velocity scaled by our simulation time step &nbsp;<img src="images/dye/eq1.png" align="center" />:
        </p>
        <br>

        <div align="center">
            <img src="images/dye/eq2.png" />
        </div>

        <br>

        <p>
            The reason for this is because we can assume that the particles of the fluid will follow the
            velocities at the positions. So, if we know where the particles at the current coordinate position
            are coming from, we can figure out the color of the current pixel.
        </p>

        <p>
            Interestingly, we implemented two methods for the dye advection: nearest and bilinear interpolation
            sampling. Since c’(t) most likely will not be a position that we save, we must use either nearest or
            linear interpolation to sample what color the current pixel should be. Nearest sampling would mean
            to simply use the color closest to c’(t). Using bilinear interpolation would mean using the four
            closest pixel’s colors to sample a new color, a mix between all four. See how the rendered frames
            are different between these two sampling methods in the results section of the web page.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h3 align="left">Problems We Ran Into</h3>
        <p>
            One problem we encountered was that our visual results initially appeared "blocky" after
            implementing the different fragment shaders. The colors formed large square-like chunks instead of
            diffusing into each other. First, we confirmed that all the fragment shaders were being called
            properly in the code. Next, we analyzed all of the fragment shader code to see if we had made a math
            error, but couldn't find anything. Finally, we suspected that it may be a floating point issue, and
            by enabling a WebGL floating point extension for the color buffer of textures, we were able to fix
            our issue:

            Another problem we encountered was correctly switching between textures while first learning and
            implementing the render-to-texture method. Our bug was that we were not binding the correct texture
            to the framebuffer for every call to the fragment shaders -- we first bound a blank texture to the
            framebuffer but then never updated the texture that should be written to with every subsequent
            timestep. This meant we wrote to the appropriate texture on the first frame generated, but then
            failed to write to the other texture on the second frame, instead reading and modifying the same
            texture simultaneously. This resulted in what appeared to be black and white flashes on our screen
            when running the simulation. We fixed this by explicitly specifying the texture we want to write
            into by binding that texture to the framebuffer with every call to a shader program. This resolved
            the flashing screen issue and also properly updated the values used for computation by correctly
            ping-ponging between the textures.
        </p>

        <p>
            Finally, one potential problem we narrowly avoided was that only a minimum of eight textures are
            guaranteed to be supported by graphics hardware when using WebGL. We ended up using seven of those
            eight guaranteed texture allocations. Had we needed more, either some graphics hardware would not
            have been able to render our simulation or we could have gotten around this by storing the extra
            textures in CPU memory, and only binding them as needed to the GPU, though we expect a significant
            performance hit to the fluid simulation would also result from this solution.

        <h3 align="left">Lessons Learned</h3>
        <p>
            We learned a variety of technical and non-technical lessons. In terms of technical lessons, we first
            learned the basics of WebGL by experimenting with simple shaders. Next, we learned about the
            render-to-texture technique of linking together several shaders by ping-ponging data between two
            textures. We needed this knowledge to write four fragment shaders -- one for advection, divergence,
            pressure, and velocity update. At this point, we spent a lot of time learning about the
            Navier-Stokes equations and approximation techniques to solve them, such as the finite difference
            method and the Jacobi method.
        </p>
        <p>
            In terms of non-technical lessons, we learned that writing shader programs is very different from
            writing other programs. For instance, techniques such as print-debugging and breakpoints are not as
            readily available and can only be accessed by running a graphics-specific debugger which can capture
            buffer information for a captured frame. Additionally, rather than being able to explicitly print
            the information stored in variables, we instead printed various colors to the canvas representing
            different values from the buffer and comparing the displayed colors to our expectations given how we
            wanted the program to behave. Lastly, a successful graphics program can sometimes be subjective, as
            results are visual and success can depend on aesthetics. We also learned that it is important to
            understand the fundamentals of your tools (such as WebGL) before wandering down rabbit holes. We
            spent a considerable amount of time developing our simulation to utilize WebGL Point objects for
            every pixel on the canvas before realizing that we could interpolate across all of the pixels just
            by using two triangles and fragment shaders with the necessary velocity, pressure, and divergence
            information stored in 2D textures that are readily sampled by the fragment shaders. Our incremental
            approach to learning WebGL was initially slow, but it paid off in the end as we were able to build
            on our knowledge and fill in gaps quickly.

            Below is a picture of the color map without advecting velocity and using nearest sampling of colors.
            We can see the fluid is being compressed at the edges of the “diamonds” of vortices, which is
            incorrect if we’re modeling an incompressible fluid.

            Below are two screenshots displaying the fluid simulation, advecting the color dye, using bilinear

                            create new colors. However, the underlying behavior of the fluid is the same as the
                            one above. It creates a very cool picture

            We also generated visualizations of the different computational stages, such as the pressure map,
            velocity map, and divergence map which is used to advect the dye (color) map and display the fluid
            simulation. The first video below shows the simulated pressure map. The darker/black color shows
            zero pressure, while the blue and yellow colors show negative and positive pressure respectively. As
            the simulation progresses, it is expected for the pressure map to equalize to a fixed color since
            the pressure should eventually equalize with non-compressible fluids.

            The following video shows the simulated velocity map. The hue of the color represents the direction
            of the velocity, where the angle maps to a point on the standard color wheel. The brightness
            represents the magnitude of the velocity, so faster moving fluid shows up brighter and still fluid
            shows up as black.

            This last video shows the simulated divergence map. The divergence map displays the grid squares in
            the simulation which have divergent velocities. In other words, the brighter colored areas in the
            divergence map indicate areas in the simulation where adjacent velocities are significantly
            different than the current velocity stored in the current texel. The brightest areas of the
            divergence map indicate adjacent velocities with fluid traveling in opposite directions while the
            darker or black areas of the divergence map indicate areas of the simulation where adjacent
            velocities are nearly the same if not the same. Our expectation from the Navier-Stokes equations,
            which we observe, is that as the simulation progresses, the divergence map will eventually become
            black as divergence of velocities should eventually become zero. Intuitively, it would make sense to
            have adjacent velocities in opposite directions of each other in a fluid simulation.
